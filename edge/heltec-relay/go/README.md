Until [this PR](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/pull/3937) goes through, you need to build the `tinygo` binary from source. That means this is highly experimental. My love for go cannot be hidden, and this would be my preferred method to program this device. I guess that's the cost of being on the bleeding edge huh....
