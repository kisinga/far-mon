# Raspberry Pi

This directory contains the code and configuration for the Raspberry Pi edge stack.

All custom services are built into a single Docker container from the Go source in the `src` directory.

For detailed setup and configuration instructions, see the [Raspberry Pi Setup documentation](../../docs/README.md#5-raspberry-pi-setup).
