# Heltec Development Journey & Lessons Learned

## Overview

This document chronicles the real-world experience of implementing firmware for Heltec LoRa devices in the farm monitoring system. It serves as a cautionary tale and learning resource for future development decisions.

## The Challenge

We needed to implement firmware for Heltec devices that could:
- Read from various I/O sensors
- Send periodic ping/heartbeat messages
- Maintain connection state between devices
- Handle sensor readings and transmit them via LoRa
- Make autonomous decisions on-device
- Manage device state effectively

**Target Architecture**: Remote sensor nodes ↔ Relay node ↔ Raspberry Pi bridge

## Approach #1: Raw C/C++ (Arduino Framework)

### Duration: ~1 week
### Outcome: ❌ Failed

**What We Tried:**
- Direct Arduino/ESP32 programming in C/C++
- Basic LoRa communication setup
- Sensor interfacing

**Challenges Encountered:**
1. **Code Complexity Management**: As soon as the code grew beyond basic examples, it became unwieldy
2. **State Management**: Keeping track of connection states, sensor readings, and communication protocols was challenging
3. **LLM-Assisted Development Issues**:
   - "Vibe coding" produced buggy, unmaintainable code
   - Performance issues in generated code
   - Significant debugging overhead
   - Burned through Cursor editor credits due to excessive back-and-forth
4. **Skill Gap**: Limited C/C++ experience made complex implementations difficult

**Key Learning**: LLM-assisted coding for complex embedded systems can be problematic when you don't have strong fundamentals in the language.

## Approach #2: Meshtastic

### Duration: Several days
### Outcome: ❌ Failed

**What We Tried:**
- Using [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) as a pre-built communication layer
- Attempting to interface with custom sensors

**Pros:**
- ✅ Excellent, feature-rich communication software
- ✅ Robust mesh networking capabilities
- ✅ Active community and documentation

**Cons & Deal-breakers:**
1. **Rigidity**: Very opinionated about how devices should work
2. **Custom Sensor Integration**: Required deep understanding of Meshtastic's complex APIs
3. **Stability Issues**: **CRITICAL** - Devices frequently froze up during operation
4. **Limited Customization**: Difficult to implement custom business logic

**Key Learning**: Meshtastic is excellent for standard mesh communication but not suitable when you need custom sensor integration and device-specific logic.

## Approach #3: Tasmota

### Duration: 2 full days
### Outcome: ❌ Failed

**What We Tried:**
- Using [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/) as a feature-rich firmware base
- Custom compilation using [TasmoCompiler](https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler)
- Sensor driver integration

**Pros:**
- ✅ Incredibly feature-packed firmware
- ✅ Built-in drivers for vast array of sensors and devices
- ✅ Excellent web-based configuration
- ✅ TasmoCompiler makes custom builds easy

**Challenges:**
1. **Limited Progress**: After 2 days of debugging, only got onboard button reading to work
2. **Complex Configuration**: Custom commands and recompilation cycles were time-consuming
3. **LoRa Integration**: Tasmota is primarily WiFi-focused; LoRa support is limited
4. **Debugging Difficulty**: Hard to troubleshoot when things don't work as expected

**Tools Used:**
- [TasmoCompiler](https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler) - Web GUI for custom Tasmota compilation
- Multiple firmware variations and configurations

**Key Learning**: Tasmota is fantastic for WiFi-based IoT devices but may not be the right fit for LoRa-based communication systems.

## Current State & Next Steps

### Re-evaluating Raw C/C++

After experiencing the limitations of higher-level frameworks, we're considering returning to raw C/C++ with a different approach:

**Potential Strategies:**
1. **Start Simple**: Build incrementally, testing each component thoroughly
2. **Better Architecture**: Plan the code structure before implementing
3. **Avoid LLM Over-reliance**: Use LLMs for specific problems, not entire implementations
4. **Reference Implementations**: Study working LoRa projects as templates

### Alternative Considerations

1. **MicroPython/CircuitPython**: Steeper learning curve worries, coupled with performance concerns
2. **ESP-IDF**: More control than Arduino framework, steeper learning curve
3. **Platform.IO**: Better project management and dependency handling
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use existing libraries for complex parts (LoRa, sensors) and custom code for business logic

## Lessons Learned

### Development Approach
- ❌ **Don't**: Rely heavily on LLM code generation without strong fundamentals
- ❌ **Don't**: Assume high-level frameworks will solve complex custom requirements
- ✅ **Do**: Start with simple, working examples and build incrementally
- ✅ **Do**: Understand the underlying hardware and protocols before adding abstraction layers

### Tool Selection
- **Meshtastic**: Great for standard mesh networking, poor for custom sensor integration
- **Tasmota**: Excellent for WiFi IoT, limited for LoRa applications
- **TasmoCompiler**: Valuable tool for Tasmota development
- **Raw C/C++**: Higher learning curve but maximum flexibility

### Time Investment
- Total time spent: ~2 weeks
- Major bottlenecks: LLM debugging cycles, framework limitations
- Key insight: Sometimes the "harder" path (raw coding) is actually faster long-term

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Start with Working Examples**: Find proven LoRa communication examples first
2. **Incremental Development**: Add one feature at a time
3. **Proper Testing Strategy**: Test each component in isolation
4. **Documentation**: Document working configurations immediately
5. **Version Control**: Commit working states frequently
6. **Community Resources**: Leverage ESP32/LoRa community knowledge over LLM generation
