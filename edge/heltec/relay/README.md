# Heltec Relay Node

This directory contains the firmware for the Heltec relay node.

## Purpose

The relay node receives sensor data from remote nodes via LoRa and forwards it to the Raspberry Pi via serial. It also relays configuration commands from the Pi to the remote nodes.

For detailed information on the relay node's firmware, features, and setup, please see the [main documentation](../../docs/README.md#3-firmware).
