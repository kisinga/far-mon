# Heltec Remote Node

This directory contains the firmware for the Heltec remote sensor node.

## Purpose

The remote node reads data from attached sensors and transmits it to the relay node via LoRa. It can be configured remotely via LoRa downlink.

For detailed information on the remote node's firmware, data structures, and operation, please see the [main documentation](../../docs/README.md#3-firmware).
