# Core

This directory is a placeholder for central server code, intended for future use when the farm expands to multiple sites or requires remote analytics.

Currently, all critical backend logic resides on the Raspberry Pi in `edge/pi/`.

For more information, see the [main documentation](https://github.com/kisinga/farm/blob/main/docs/README.md).
