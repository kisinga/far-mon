# core/ â€” Central Server Code (Placeholder)

- Code for home/cloud aggregation, if/when the farm expands to multi-site or requires remote analytics.
- Currently, all critical backend logic lives on the Pi in `edge/pi/thingsboard/`.

**To enable sync/aggregation with a home server:**  
- Add ETL scripts, Rule Engine configs, or MQTT/HTTP bridges here.
