# far-mon  
**Monitor your farm. From far. Farm on!**

A modular, resilient farm-monitoring platform that **consolidates resources** and **plugs into** ERPNext (or any farm ERP) for unified record-keeping and analytics.

---

## 🎯 Why far-mon?

1. **Data-Driven Decisions**  
   Turn raw sensor data into interventions that boost yield, efficiency, and water-use.  
2. **Edge-First Resilience**  
   Low-maintenance, offline-capable nodes keep running—even when the network flutters.  
3. **ERP-Agnostic Integration**  
   Focus on monitoring and control; let ERPNext handle inventory, finance, traceability.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

[ Remote ] ── LoRa ── [ Relay ] ── Serial ── [ Pi Edge ] ── MQTT/REST ── [ ERPNext / Dashboard ]

- **Remote Nodes**  
  – ESP32/Heltec devices  
  – SensorConfig schema, NVS persistence  
- **Relay Nodes**  
  – LoRa ↔ Serial bridge  
  – Downlink command dispatch  
- **Pi Edge Node**  
  – Aggregation, config pushes, local DB  
  – Threshold “rule engine” daemon  
- **Integration Layer**  
  – MQTT or REST → ERPNext Adapter  
  – Time-series ingestion service

## ⚙️ Capabilities (MVP)

| Domain       | What we measure                   | Hardware / Method                |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Water       | Tank level, borehole flow, rain   | HC-SR04, tipping bucket, API     |
| Soil        | Moisture                          | Capacitive probes                |
| Livestock   | Goat weight, health              | Manual scale or RFID gate        |
| Fodder      | Harvest time, regrowth rate      | Logs + moisture probe            |
| Hives       | Temp, humidity, activity         | Thermal probe, IR motion counter |
| System      | Uptime, solar output, leaks      | Pulse counters, shunt sensors    |

_All measurements flow through SensorConfig → Pi → ERPNext (or dashboard)._

## 🚀 MVP Action Items

1. **Tank Monitoring** – Over-/under-flow alerts  
2. **Rain Gauge** – Irrigation suppression logic  
3. **Soil Moisture** – Dynamic irrigation triggers  
4. **Goat Weighing** – Growth tracking dashboard  
5. **Crop Events** – Mobile form logging  
6. **Hive Health** – Pre-swarm warnings

## 🔌 Near-Term Extensions

- **Sunverter 4b** (RS-485) → Solar metrics  
- **Pump Runtime** → Efficiency analytics  
- **Zonal Nodes** → Per-plot decisions  
- **Local Dashboard** → Web UI on Pi  
- **Rule Engine** → Configurable thresholds

## 📆 ERPNext Integration Roadmap

1. **Device Registry** in ERPNext for sensor metadata  
2. **Time-Series Bridge** (Pi → MQTT/REST → ERPNext)  
3. **Offline Mobile Forms** (goats, crops, maintenance)  
4. **Auto-Reports** for yield, water use, cost vs. field conditions  
5. **ERP Hooks** for livestock, crop, inventory sync
