# far-mon

**Monitor your farm. From far. Farm on!**

A modular, resilient farm-monitoring platform that **consolidates resources** and **plugs into** ERPNext (or any farm ERP) for unified record-keeping and analytics.

---

## üéØ Why far-mon?

1. **Data-Driven Decisions**  
   Turn raw sensor data into interventions that boost yield, efficiency, and water-use.
2. **Edge-First Resilience**  
   Low-maintenance, offline-capable nodes keep running‚Äîeven when the network flutters.
3. **ERP-Agnostic Integration**  
   Focus on monitoring and control; let ERPNext handle inventory, finance, traceability.

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

> **Note:** This system is currently undergoing a strategic migration from a custom LoRa protocol to the industry-standard LoRaWAN protocol. The architecture described below reflects the target state. For details on the phased migration, see the [LoRaWAN Migration Guide](edge/heltec/LoRaWAN_migration_guide.md).

- **Remote Nodes (LoRaWAN End Devices)**
  ‚Äì ESP32/Heltec devices refactored to be LoRaWAN Class A compliant.
  ‚Äì Firmware supports an AT command interface for remote configuration via downlinks.
  ‚Äì Battery-powered with solar charging.
- **LoRaWAN Gateway**
  ‚Äì Replaces the original Heltec `relay` node.
  ‚Äì A standard LoRaWAN gateway (e.g., Raspberry Pi with an SX1302 HAT).
  ‚Äì Forwards raw LoRaWAN packets to the Network Server (ChirpStack) on the Pi Edge Node.
  ‚Äì _Transitional Phase_: The existing Heltec `relay` node will temporarily act as a minimal packet forwarder until the gateway hardware is deployed.
- **Pi Edge Node**
  ‚Äì Runs the core network services in Docker containers managed by Coolify.
  ‚Äì **LoRaWAN Network Server (ChirpStack)**: Manages the LoRaWAN network, devices, and forwards decoded data to MQTT.
  ‚Äì MQTT broker, Node-RED automation, InfluxDB storage.
  ‚Äì Tailscale VPN for secure remote access.
- **Management Layer**
  ‚Äì Coolify VPS for deployment orchestration
  ‚Äì Tailscale network for secure connectivity
  ‚Äì SSH tunneling for device access
  ‚Äì GitOps workflow for updates
